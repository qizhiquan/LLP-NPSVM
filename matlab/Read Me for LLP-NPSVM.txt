Matalb code for LLP-NPSVM (Version 0.1)

*****************************************************************************************
**

This is a matlab for  LLP-NPSVM model. You could use these code to construct classification model for Learning with Label Proportions(LLP) problem.

runningDemo.m: the sample code for illustrating how to use these functions.

NPSVM_Parameters.m: matlab struct for model parameters.

NPSVM_Train.m: train a model by nonparallel support vector machine.

NPSVMLLP.m:    train a model for LLP problem by LLP-NPSVM method




npsvmpredict.mexw64, npsvmpredict.mexw64, npsvmtrain.mexw32, npsvmpredict.mexw32: matlab mex files for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.

32-bit mex files:
npsvmtrain.mexw32: 32-bit nonparallel support vector machine model constructor.

64-bit mex files:
npsvmtrain.mexw64: 64-bit nonparallel support vector machine model constructor.


toydata.mat: a sample dataset for testing the sample code.
